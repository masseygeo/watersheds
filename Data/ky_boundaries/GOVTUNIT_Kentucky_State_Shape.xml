                        <othercit>The boundary is a digital representation of the International boundary between the United States and Canada as per the Treaty of 1908. It has been generated from a combination of recent surveys and datum conversions. It is intended for mapping purposes only. The boundary dataset is composed of 29 segments that correspond to the original 256 boundary maps. Attributes of each segment define the scale in which the line in that area may be accurately depicted. It is produced for mapping purposes only and not intended to illustrate the boundary beyond the limits of the scale for any given segment.</othercit>

                        <othercit>The forest service boundaries defined by the USDA Forest Service encompass the National Forest System (NFS) lands within the original Proclaimed National Forests, along with lands added to the NFS which have taken on the status of 'reserved from the public domain' under the General Exchange Act. PROCLAIMED boundaries (e.g. ProclaimedForest and ProclaimedForest_Grassland) encompass areas of National Forest System land that is set aside and reserved from public domain by executive order or proclamation. The nationwide Proclaimed Forest dataset was created by the USDA Forest Service, Washington Office Automated Lands Program (ALP) staff from collected source data created by the Regional Offices. These geospatial data and related maps or graphics are not legal documents and are not intended to be used as such. The user is responsible to verify the limitations of the geospatial data and to use the data accordingly. Only maps in USDA Forest Service areas will contain USDA Forest boundaries.</othercit>

                        <othercit>This dataset depicts the authoritative boundaries of the most commonly known Department of Defense (DoD) sites, installations, ranges, and training areas in the United States and Territories. These sites encompass land which is federally owned or otherwise managed. This dataset was compiled by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) Program. This dataset represents the baseline for georeferenced boundaries of sites selected from the 2010 Base Structure Report. The boundary locations are intended for planning purposes only and do not represent the legal or surveyed land parcel boundaries. This list does not necessarily represent a comprehensive collection of all DoD facilities, and only those in the fifty United States and US Territories were considered for inclusion. Maps produced at a scale of 1:50,000 or larger which otherwise comply with National Map Accuracy Standards will remain compliant if this data is incorporated. Although these data have been provided by the DoD components, no warranty expressed or implied is made regarding the utility of the data on any other system, in derived products or data alterations, nor shall the act of distribution constitute such warranty.</othercit>

The USGS converted areas of generally 3 acres or less to point features to facilitate cartographic display on the US Topo digital map product. See Source URL for link to complete dataset. This data set is complete but subject to continual updates to reflect boundary amendments, legislation, and acquisitions, and improved processing techniques. The data is being regularly updated with verified boundaries from NPS Land Resources Division. The data is intended for use as a tool for display and general GIS analysis purposes only. It is in no way intended for engineering or legal purposes. The data accuracy is checked against best available sources which may be dated. NPS assumes no liability for use of this data. Boundaries from the Land Resources Division have separate polygons for each type of unit. For example, Denali National Park and Denali National Preserve are separate, individual polygons.</othercit>

                        <othercit>The boundaries of most unincorporated places in this shapefile are as of January 1, 2017, as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). Limited updates that occurred after January 1, 2017, such as newly unincorporated places, are also included. The boundaries of all Census Designated Places (CDPs) were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census. The USGS uses the TIGER data without editing or alteration.</othercit>

                        <othercit>These boundaries are simplified from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Real Estate Interest data layer containing polygons representing tracts of land (parcels) in which the Service has a real estate interest. Interior boundaries between parcels were dissolved to produce a single set of simplified external boundaries for each feature. These are resource grade mapping representations of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service boundaries. For legal descriptions of the land represented here, contact the USFWS Realty Office. This map layer was compiled by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Although these boundaries represent lands administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, not all areas are open to the public. Some fragile habitats need to be protected from human traffic and some management areas are closed. The public is urged to contact specific Refuges or other conservation areas before visiting.  The primary source for this information is the USFWS Realty program. Data can also be downloaded from ServCat, the FWS Catalog.</othercit>

                        <othercit>The PLSS information is for general reference purposes only, and should not be used to determine legal boundaries or land ownership. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is the authoritative source for PLSS information at the federal level, and the US Topo representation is derived from BLM GIS data files called Cadastral National Spatial Data Infrastructure or CadNSDI. The management of these data is not completely uniform throughout the country. Although this metadata record is included with all maps, PLSS is currently shown on US Topo Maps for only a few states. PLSS will be added to US Topo maps in more states in coming years as BLM authorized CadNSDI format is made available. The three layers USGS stores from PLSS are the Township, First Division and Special Surveys. Metadata for BLM PLSS data is at https://gbp-blm-egis.hub.arcgis.com. Alternate sources of PLSS data will continue to be served mainly in western states where BLM is the data steward or where the data is from a trusted source. Notes on individual states follow,----Alaska PLSS consists of protracted (computed, not surveyed) data only. For more information see http://sdms.ak.blm.gov/sdms ----Ohio was the original PLSS state in the early 1800s, and the land network there is unusually complex. The source data include four first-division parcel types. These are all shown on US Topo maps, and are labeled according to BLM's attribution, with a leading letter followed by either a number or more letters. The meanings of the leading letters are S=Section, F=Fractional Section, L=Lot, Q=Quarter Township.</othercit>
